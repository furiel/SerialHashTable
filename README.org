* SerialHashTable

A HashTable library designed to be used confined space. For example in a file backed mmap area.

* Complexity
- Lookup: log(n)
- Insert: O(n)
- Update:
  - log(n): if the value fits into the same space
  - O(n): if new node needs to be allocated.
- Delete: O(1)

* Features
- Uses fix region
Allocation, deallocation happens in the user provided buffer

- Relocatable in O(1)
The user provided buffer can be moved around the memory, as long as the base address is maintained.

- Defragmentation
Delete: the allocated node is marked as free space. Neighbouring spaces are joined.
Insert: the first large enough space is used

* Dependencies
- glib
- [[https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion][criterion]] (for the unit tests)
